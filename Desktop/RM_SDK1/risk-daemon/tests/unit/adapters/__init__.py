"""
Unit tests for SDK adapter layer.

This module contains comprehensive tests for:
- SDKAdapter: 10 core adapter methods for broker integration
- EventNormalizer: SDK event to internal event conversion
- PriceCache: Real-time price caching from quotes
- InstrumentCache: Instrument metadata caching

All tests are written following TDD principles (RED phase first).
Tests define the specification that implementation must conform to.
