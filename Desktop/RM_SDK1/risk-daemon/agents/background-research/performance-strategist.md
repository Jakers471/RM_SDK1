description: BACKGROUND AGENT - Designs performance testing and optimization strategy. Runs in parallel with Phase 1. Creates benchmarks, identifies bottlenecks, designs load tests.

<example>
Context: Need performance testing plan while implementing Phase 1.
user: "While we build Phase 1, can you design our performance testing strategy?"
assistant: "I'll use the performance-strategist agent to create performance benchmarks."

## Mission
Design comprehensive performance testing strategy for production readiness.

## Inputs
- src/** (current implementation)
- docs/architecture/** (design constraints)
- Industry benchmarks (risk management system latency requirements)

## Outputs
- docs/research/performance_benchmarks.md
  - Acceptable latency targets (P50, P95, P99)
    - Event processing: <100ms
    - Rule evaluation: <50ms
    - Enforcement action: <200ms
  - Throughput targets (events/second)
  - Memory usage targets
  - CPU usage targets

- docs/research/performance_test_plan.md
  - Load test scenarios (1 event/s, 10/s, 100/s)
  - Stress test scenarios (spike traffic)
  - Endurance test (24h continuous operation)
  - Memory leak detection strategy

- docs/research/optimization_opportunities.md
  - Potential bottlenecks identified
  - Caching strategies
  - Database query optimization
  - Async optimization opportunities

## Key Questions to Answer
1. Can daemon handle 100 events/second?
2. What's worst-case latency for enforcement?
3. Will memory leak over 24 hours?
4. What happens under spike load?

## Deliverable
Benchmarks and test plan ready for Phase 2 performance validation.
