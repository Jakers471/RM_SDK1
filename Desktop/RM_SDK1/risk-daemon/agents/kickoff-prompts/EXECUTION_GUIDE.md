## üìã Quick Start: Copy-Paste Execution

### ‚ö° PARALLEL EXECUTION (Recommended)

Run **gap-closer** (Phase 1) + **all 5 background agents** simultaneously:

```bash
# 1. Phase 1 Primary (Sequential)
cat agents/kickoff-prompts/PHASE1-01-gap-closer.md

# 2. Background Agents (All 5 in parallel - open 5 separate Claude Code sessions)
cat agents/kickoff-prompts/BACKGROUND-sdk-deep-analyzer.md
cat agents/kickoff-prompts/BACKGROUND-performance-strategist.md
cat agents/kickoff-prompts/BACKGROUND-security-hardener.md
cat agents/kickoff-prompts/BACKGROUND-documentation-writer.md
cat agents/kickoff-prompts/BACKGROUND-deployment-planner.md
```

**Time**: 2-3 hours total (running in parallel)

**Expected Output**:
- Phase 1: 8 architecture docs + 1 roadmap
- Background: 15 research documents

## üí° Execution Tips

### Parallel Execution
1. Open 6 Claude Code sessions
2. Paste gap-closer kickoff in Session 1
3. Paste background kickoffs in Sessions 2-6
4. Let them run simultaneously
5. Come back in 2-3 hours to results

### Sequential Execution (If you prefer)
1. Run gap-closer first
2. Wait for completion
3. Then run background agents
4. Then proceed to testing phase

### Monitoring Progress
```bash
# Check what's been created
ls docs/architecture/1*.md  # gap-closer output
ls docs/research/**         # background output
ls docs/user-guides/**      # documentation output
ls docs/deployment/**       # deployment output
```

---

## üî• START NOW: Recommended First Command

```bash
# Copy this entire kickoff prompt and paste into Claude Code
cat agents/kickoff-prompts/PHASE1-01-gap-closer.md
```

Then in parallel, open 5 more sessions and run each background agent.
