# PHASE 1 - STEP 1: Gap Closer Agent Kickoff

**Agent**: gap-closer
**Model**: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
**Priority**: P0 (MUST RUN FIRST)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Status**: Ready to run

---

## üìñ FIRST: Read Your Agent Definition

**CRITICAL**: Before starting, read your complete agent definition:
```
agents/1-current-implementation/gap-closer.md
```

This file contains your full mission, constraints, and quality standards. The kickoff below is a quick-start summary.

---

## üéØ Your Mission

You are the **gap-closer** agent. Your job is to read the 4 comprehensive audit reports and design complete architecture specifications for ALL missing components identified in the audits.

## üìö Required Reading (Read ALL of these first)

1. **docs/audits/01_Architecture_Audit.md**
   - Focus on: "Planned but Missing" section
   - Extract: All P0 and P1 missing components

2. **docs/audits/02_Testing_Coverage_Audit.md**
   - Focus on: "Untested Modules" section (0% coverage)
   - Extract: connection_manager, main.py, persistence requirements

3. **docs/audits/03_Deployment_Roadmap.md**
   - Focus on: "Mock Points Inventory" and dependencies
   - Extract: Component dependency relationships

4. **docs/audits/04_SDK_Integration_Analysis.md**
   - Focus on: "Critical Mismatches" section
   - Extract: Authentication, event handling requirements

5. **docs/architecture/** (ALL existing files)
   - Study existing documentation style, format, and patterns
   - Match the level of detail and structure

## üìù Your Deliverables

Create these architecture documents (match existing doc format exactly):

### Required Architecture Documents

1. **docs/architecture/16-configuration-system.md**
   - ConfigManager, ConfigValidator, ConfigLoader components
   - JSON schema for config files
   - Hot-reload capability
   - Integration with RiskEngine and Admin CLI

2. **docs/architecture/17-windows-service-wrapper.md**
   - NSSM integration
   - Daemon lifecycle management
   - Graceful shutdown and restart on crash
   - Admin privilege checking

3. **docs/architecture/18-admin-cli.md**
   - Password authentication
   - Commands: start/stop daemon, configure rules, view status
   - IPC communication protocol
   - Help system and command structure

4. **docs/architecture/19-notification-service.md**
   - Discord webhook integration
   - Telegram bot API
   - Alert routing and rate limiting
   - Message formatting templates

5. **docs/architecture/20-structured-logging.md**
   - Logger setup with JSON format
   - Log levels and rotation
   - Admin/trader/audit log separation
   - Integration with EventBus

6. **docs/architecture/21-connection-manager-hardening.md**
   - Reconnection logic and exponential backoff
   - State reconciliation after disconnect
   - Event replay and gap detection
   - Health monitoring

7. **docs/architecture/22-state-persistence-verification.md**
   - SQLite schema design
   - State recovery from crash
   - Migration handling
   - Backup strategy

8. **docs/architecture/23-ipc-api-layer.md**
   - HTTP API or Named Pipe design
   - Request/response protocol
   - Security (localhost only)
   - CLI communication

### Implementation Roadmap

9. **docs/plans/gap_closure_roadmap.md**
   - Component dependency graph
   - Implementation phases (Week 1, Week 2, etc.)
   - For EACH component, specify handoff to TDD workflow:
     - gap-closer ‚Üí rm-test-orchestrator ‚Üí rm-developer ‚Üí implementation-validator
   - Success criteria and verification steps

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You succeed when:
- [ ] All 8 architecture documents created
- [ ] Each doc follows existing architecture doc format (Overview, Requirements, Architecture, Components, Interfaces, Integration Points, Error Handling, Testing Strategy)
- [ ] Implementation roadmap with clear dependencies
- [ ] Every P0 missing component from audits addressed
- [ ] Ready for rm-test-orchestrator to begin test creation

## üî• Design Principles (CRITICAL)

**Follow Existing Patterns**:
- Use async/await patterns (all existing code is async)
- Use dataclasses for models
- Type hints everywhere
- Docstrings in Google format
- EventBus integration for all components

**Mocked Testing Philosophy**:
- ALL tests must use mocks (FakeSdk, FakeConfig, FakeClock)
- NO live SDK connections in Phase 1
- Tests must be deterministic and fast

**TDD Workflow Respect**:
- Your architecture docs feed into rm-test-orchestrator
- Do NOT write test specifications (test-orchestrator's job)
- Do NOT write code (rm-developer's job)
- Focus on WHAT to build, not HOW to test/implement

## üìä Output Summary Template

When done, report:

```
‚úÖ Architecture Design Complete

Created 8 Architecture Documents:
- 16-configuration-system.md (P0, no dependencies)
- 17-windows-service-wrapper.md (P0, depends on: config, logging)
- 18-admin-cli.md (P0, depends on: config, IPC)
- 19-notification-service.md (P1, depends on: config, logging)
- 20-structured-logging.md (P0, depends on: config)
- 21-connection-manager-hardening.md (P0, depends on: state, logging)
- 22-state-persistence-verification.md (P0, depends on: logging)
- 23-ipc-api-layer.md (P0, depends on: config)

Created Implementation Roadmap:
- docs/plans/gap_closure_roadmap.md
- [X] week implementation plan
- Dependency-ordered phases
- Clear handoff to TDD workflow

Next Step:
‚Üí Hand off to rm-test-orchestrator for test creation
‚Üí Roadmap specifies: config ‚Üí logging ‚Üí persistence ‚Üí connection ‚Üí notifications ‚Üí CLI ‚Üí service
```
