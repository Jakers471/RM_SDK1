# Trader Guide: Understanding the Risk Daemon

## What is the Risk Daemon?

The Risk Daemon is your trading guardian. It automatically monitors your positions and enforces risk limits to protect you from excessive losses.

**Think of it as**: A safety net that prevents you from over-trading or taking excessive risk.

## How It Protects You

### 1. Position Limits
- **Max Contracts**: Won't let you hold more than X contracts total
- **Max Per Symbol**: Won't let you over-concentrate in one symbol

### 2. Loss Protection
- **Daily Loss Limit**: Flattens you if you lose more than $X in a day
- **Unrealized Loss**: Closes positions if underwater by $X

### 3. Profit Protection
- **Daily Profit Target**: Takes you out when you hit daily goal
- **Unrealized Profit**: Locks in profits automatically

### 4. Time-Based Rules
- **Trading Hours**: Blocks trading outside 8:30am - 3:00pm CT
- **End-of-Day**: Flattens you at 3:00pm CT if still in positions

### 5. Safety Rules
- **Stop Loss Required**: Must place stop within 2 minutes of entry
- **Cooldown After Loss**: Pause trading after big loss

## What Happens When a Rule Triggers?

### Example 1: Hit Daily Loss Limit
1. Daemon detects you've lost $500 (your limit)
2. **Automatically closes ALL positions**
3. **Locks you out for rest of day**
4. Sends Discord notification: "Daily loss limit reached"

### Example 2: Exceed Position Limit
1. You try to enter 6 contracts (limit is 5)
2. **Order is rejected**
3. Notification: "Max contracts exceeded"

### Example 3: No Stop Loss Placed
1. You enter position without stop loss
2. **Wait 2 minutes**
3. **Daemon automatically flattens position**
4. Notification: "Stop loss not placed in time"

## Can I Override the Daemon?

**Short Answer**: No (by design)

**Why?**: The whole point is protection. If you could override it, you'd defeat the purpose.

**Exception**: Admin can manually override in emergencies.

## Understanding Notifications

### Discord Notifications

You'll receive messages like:
- ‚úÖ "Risk rule triggered: Daily loss limit"
- ‚úÖ "Action taken: Flattened all positions"
- ‚úÖ "Reason: Exceeded $500 daily loss"
- ‚úÖ "Lockout until: 5:00pm CT"

### What Each Notification Means
- **"Flattened"**: All positions closed
- **"Lockout"**: Can't trade until time specified
- **"Rejected"**: New order blocked
- **"Cooldown"**: Pause before next trade allowed

## FAQ

### Q: Why was I flattened?
A: Check Discord. Notification tells you which rule triggered and why.

### Q: Can I trade after being flattened?
A: Depends on the rule. Daily loss = locked until tomorrow. Max contracts = can trade once you're below limit.

### Q: What if I disagree with a rule trigger?
A: Talk to admin. They can review logs and adjust rules if needed.

### Q: Does the daemon ever stop working?
A: It's designed to run 24/7. If it crashes, admin gets alerted immediately.

### Q: What happens if my internet disconnects?
A: Daemon reconnects automatically. Any missed events are caught up.

### Q: Can I see my current limits?
A: Ask admin or check your trader dashboard (if available).

# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues

### Daemon Won't Start
**Symptoms**: Service fails to start, error in logs
**Causes**:
- SDK credentials invalid
- Config file malformed
- Port already in use
**Solutions**:
1. Check logs: `risk-daemon-admin logs errors`
2. Validate config: `risk-daemon-admin config validate`
3. Test SDK connection: `risk-daemon-admin test-connection`

### Tests Failing Unexpectedly
**Symptoms**: Rules not triggering, positions not closing
**Causes**:
- State out of sync
- SDK disconnected
- Config not reloaded
**Solutions**:
1. Check connection: `risk-daemon-admin status`
2. Reconcile state: `risk-daemon-admin reconcile`
3. Reload config: `risk-daemon-admin config reload`
