## üìù Your Deliverables

### 1. docs/research/security_audit.md

**Vulnerability Assessment** (categorize by severity):

#### CRITICAL Vulnerabilities
- [ ] Hardcoded API keys or credentials
- [ ] SQL injection points
- [ ] Authentication bypass
- [ ] Sensitive data in logs

#### HIGH Vulnerabilities
- [ ] Weak password requirements
- [ ] Missing input validation
- [ ] Unencrypted data transmission
- [ ] Insufficient access controls

#### MEDIUM Vulnerabilities
- [ ] Information disclosure in error messages
- [ ] Missing rate limiting
- [ ] Insufficient logging for security events
- [ ] Session management issues

#### LOW Vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verbose error messages
- [ ] Missing security headers
- [ ] Outdated dependencies

**Threat Model**:
- **Who**: Malicious trader, compromised admin, external attacker
- **What**: Bypass risk rules, steal credentials, DoS attack, data exfiltration
- **How**: API abuse, config manipulation, SDK spoofing, log injection

**Attack Vectors**:
1. **Config File Manipulation**: Attacker modifies risk rules to disable protection
2. **Admin CLI Compromise**: Weak password, gain full control
3. **Log Injection**: Inject fake enforcement logs
4. **SDK Spoofing**: Send fake fill events to trigger unwanted closures
5. **DoS**: Flood event bus with fake events

### 2. docs/research/security_hardening_plan.md

**Mitigation Strategies** for each vulnerability:

#### Credential Management
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Move all credentials to environment variables
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Use secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Rotate credentials periodically
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Never log credentials

#### Input Validation
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Validate ALL external inputs (SDK events, config files, CLI commands)
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Use JSON schema for config validation
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Sanitize log inputs (prevent log injection)
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Whitelist allowed values where possible

#### Authentication & Authorization
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Strong password requirements for Admin CLI (12+ chars, complexity)
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Password hashing with bcrypt/argon2
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Implement session timeouts
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Multi-factor authentication for admin access (optional)
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Principle of least privilege (trader vs admin access)

#### Rate Limiting
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Limit CLI command rate (10 commands/minute)
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Limit config reload rate (1/minute)
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Protect against event flood (circuit breaker)

#### Encryption
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest (SQLite database encryption)
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Use TLS for all network communication
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Encrypt admin password in config

#### Audit Logging
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Log ALL security events (auth attempts, config changes, enforcement actions)
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Separate security log (tamper-evident)
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Log to remote server (prevent local tampering)
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Include: timestamp, user, action, result

#### Error Handling
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Generic error messages to users (no stack traces)
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Detailed errors only in secure logs
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Fail securely (deny on error, not allow)

#### Code Security
- ‚úÖ **Action**: SQL parameterized queries only (no string concatenation)
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Avoid eval() or exec() (code injection risk)
- ‚úÖ **Action**: Dependency vulnerability scanning (npm audit, pip audit)

### 3. docs/research/security_checklist.md

**Pre-Production Security Review**:

```markdown

```

**Penetration Testing Plan**:

- [ ] Brute-force admin password
- [ ] Attempt to bypass authentication
- [ ] Inject malicious log entries
- [ ] Send fake SDK events (spoofing)
- [ ] DoS attack via event flood

**Vulnerability Scanning**:
- [ ] Run: `pip audit` for Python dependency vulns
- [ ] Run: `bandit` for Python code security issues
- [ ] Run: `safety check` for known vulnerabilities
