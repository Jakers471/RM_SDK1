# Kickoff Prompt: rm-test-orchestrator

**Agent Type**: TDD Test Creation Specialist
**Model**: Opus
**Purpose**: Transform architecture specs into comprehensive failing test suites
**Color**: Red (RED phase of TDD)

---

## FIRST: Read Your Agent Definition

**Primary Agent File**: `agents/existing-workflow/rm-test-orchestrator.md`

Before starting, read the full agent definition above. It contains:
- Complete operational scope (what to read, what to write)
- Gap-Closer Handoff Workflow (your primary workflow)
- Test creation methodology (contract encoding, test pyramid)
- Quality standards (assertions, fixtures, determinism)
- Self-verification checklist

---

## Quick-Start: Gap-Closer Handoff Workflow

### Context
The **gap-closer** agent just completed its mission and created:
- `architecture/16-configuration-implementation.md` (400+ lines of design specs)
- `architecture/17-service-wrapper-nssm.md` (350+ lines of Windows service design)
- `docs/plans/gap_closure_roadmap.md` (5-phase, 20-day implementation plan)
- `docs/plans/GAP_CLOSURE_SUMMARY.md` (executive summary)

The gap-closer handed off to YOU with instructions:

```
NEXT AGENT (rm-test-orchestrator):
1. Read architecture/16-configuration-implementation.md
2. Create comprehensive test specifications:
   - tests/unit/config/test_config_manager.py
   - tests/unit/config/test_pydantic_models.py
   - tests/integration/config/test_hot_reload.py
   - (5-6 test files total)
3. Set coverage target: >95%
4. Hand off to rm-developer with RED status (0/X tests passing)
```

## Your Mission (Current Handoff)

### Phase 1: Configuration System Tests

**Read These Documents:**
1. `architecture/16-configuration-implementation.md` - Complete config system design
2. `docs/plans/gap_closure_roadmap.md` - Phase 1 implementation plan
3. `docs/plans/GAP_CLOSURE_SUMMARY.md` - Overall context

**Create These Test Files:**

**Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/config/`):
1. `test_config_manager.py`
   - Config loading from TOML/YAML/ENV
   - Validation with Pydantic models
   - Error handling (missing files, invalid syntax, schema violations)
   - Default value handling
   - Environment variable override behavior

2. `test_pydantic_models.py`
   - RiskRuleConfig validation
   - NotificationConfig validation
   - AccountConfig validation
   - Field constraints (min/max values, required fields)
   - Type coercion and validation errors

3. `test_config_validation.py`
   - Cross-field validation (e.g., max > min)
   - Enum validation (valid/invalid values)
   - Nested config validation
   - Custom validators

**Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/config/`):
1. `test_hot_reload.py`
   - File system watch for config changes
   - Config reload on file modification
   - Event emission on reload
   - Rollback on invalid config
   - Race condition handling

2. `test_config_persistence.py`
   - Config save/load round-trip
   - Multi-format support (TOML, YAML, JSON)
   - File permissions and access errors

**Fixtures** (`tests/conftest.py` additions):
- `sample_config_toml` - Valid TOML config fixture
- `sample_config_yaml` - Valid YAML config fixture
- `invalid_configs` - Parametrized fixture with various invalid configs
- `temp_config_file` - Temporary config file for hot-reload tests
- `fake_file_watcher` - Mock file system watcher

## Test Coverage Targets

| Module | Target Coverage | Priority |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| src/config/config_manager.py | >95% | P0 |
| src/config/models.py | >95% | P0 |
| src/config/hot_reload.py | >90% | P1 |
| src/config/validation.py | >95% | P0 |

**Overall Phase 1 Target**: ≥85% coverage

---

## Expected Deliverables

### 1. Test Files (5-6 files)
- All tests FAIL initially (RED phase)
- Clear, descriptive test names (`test_<scenario>_<expected_outcome>`)
- AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Docstrings explaining business rules

### 2. TEST_NOTES.md Update
```markdown
# Test Coverage Summary

## Phase 1: Configuration System

### Created Tests
- [x] Unit: ConfigManager (18 tests) - ALL RED ❌
- [x] Unit: Pydantic Models (12 tests) - ALL RED ❌
- [x] Unit: Config Validation (8 tests) - ALL RED ❌
- [x] Integration: Hot Reload (6 tests) - ALL RED ❌
- [x] Integration: Config Persistence (4 tests) - ALL RED ❌

**Total**: 48 tests created, 0/48 passing (expected)

### Coverage Targets
- ConfigManager: >95%
- Pydantic Models: >95%
- Hot Reload: >90%

### Next Steps
- Hand off to rm-developer for implementation
- Target: Make all 48 tests GREEN
```

### 3. Handoff to rm-developer
Report format:
```
✅ rm-test-orchestrator COMPLETE

Tests Created: 48 tests across 5 files
Status: RED (0/48 passing) - Expected!
Coverage Target: ≥85%
Architecture Source: architecture/16-configuration-implementation.md

NEXT AGENT (rm-developer):
1. Read architecture/16-configuration-implementation.md
2. Read failing tests to understand contracts
3. Implement src/config/ modules to make tests GREEN
4. Target: 48/48 tests passing, ≥85% coverage
```

## Key Principles (from your agent definition)

### Test Quality
- **Descriptive names**: `test_config_load_from_toml_with_valid_schema_succeeds()`
- **Clear failures**: Error messages guide implementation
- **Deterministic**: Use fixtures for time, file system, randomness
- **Fast**: Unit <100ms, Integration <1s

### No Production Code
- ONLY write tests
- NEVER write `src/**` code
- Use fakes/mocks for external dependencies
- Tests must fail until implementation

### Contract Encoding
From architecture/16-configuration-implementation.md:
- Extract exact interfaces (inputs, outputs, exceptions)
- Test edge cases (empty configs, missing files, malformed data)
- Test invariants (config always valid after load)
- Test error paths (what happens when things go wrong)
