# Kickoff Prompt: rm-developer

**Agent Type**: Clean Architecture Implementation Specialist
**Model**: Opus
**Purpose**: Turn failing tests GREEN with minimal, elegant code
**Color**: Green (GREEN phase of TDD)

---

## FIRST: Read Your Agent Definition

**Primary Agent File**: `agents/existing-workflow/rm-developer.md`

Before starting, read the full agent definition above. It contains:
- Complete workflow (analyze tests → review architecture → implement → refactor)
- Gap-Closer Workflow Integration (your primary workflow)
- Clean architecture principles (core vs. edge, adapter patterns)
- Quality standards (docstrings, file size, readability)
- Decision-making framework

---

## Quick-Start: Gap-Closer Handoff Workflow

### Context
You are receiving a handoff from **rm-test-orchestrator**, which received a handoff from **gap-closer**. The workflow so far:

1. ✅ **gap-closer**: Created architecture specs in `architecture/16-configuration-implementation.md`
2. ✅ **rm-test-orchestrator**: Created 48 failing tests based on those specs
3. 👉 **YOU (rm-developer)**: Implement code to make those 48 tests GREEN

---

## Your Mission (Current Handoff)

### Phase 1: Configuration System Implementation

**Status from rm-test-orchestrator:**
```
✅ rm-test-orchestrator COMPLETE

Tests Created: 48 tests across 5 files
Status: RED (0/48 passing) - Expected!
Coverage Target: ≥85%
Architecture Source: architecture/16-configuration-implementation.md

NEXT AGENT (rm-developer):
1. Read architecture/16-configuration-implementation.md
2. Read failing tests to understand contracts
3. Implement src/config/ modules to make tests GREEN
4. Target: 48/48 tests passing, ≥85% coverage
```

---

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Read Architecture & Tests

**Read These Documents (in order):**
1. `architecture/16-configuration-implementation.md` - Your design blueprint (400+ lines)
2. `docs/plans/gap_closure_roadmap.md` - Phase 1 implementation plan
3. `tests/unit/config/test_config_manager.py` - What ConfigManager must do
4. `tests/unit/config/test_pydantic_models.py` - What models must validate
5. `tests/integration/config/test_hot_reload.py` - How hot-reload must work

**Understand:**
- What interfaces are required (classes, methods, signatures)
- What behaviors are expected (inputs → outputs)
- What edge cases must be handled (errors, validation failures)
- What invariants must hold (e.g., "config always valid after load")

---

### Step 2: Plan Implementation (No Code Yet!)

Based on architecture/16-configuration-implementation.md, you need to create:

**Module Structure:**
```
src/config/
├── __init__.py          # Public API exports
├── config_manager.py    # Main ConfigManager class
├── models.py            # Pydantic validation models
├── hot_reload.py        # File watcher and reload logic
├── validation.py        # Custom validators
└── loaders.py           # TOML/YAML/JSON parsers
```

**Implementation Order** (simplest → most complex):
1. `models.py` - Pydantic models (no I/O, just validation)
2. `loaders.py` - File parsing (TOML, YAML, JSON)
3. `validation.py` - Cross-field validators
4. `config_manager.py` - Main config loading logic
5. `hot_reload.py` - File watching and reload (most complex)

---

### Step 3: Implement Incrementally (TDD RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)

**For each module:**

#### Start with Simplest Failing Test
```bash
# Run tests for models.py only
uv run pytest tests/unit/config/test_pydantic_models.py::test_risk_rule_config_valid_data -v

# Should see: FAILED (because models.py doesn't exist yet)
```

#### Write Minimal Code to Pass That Test
```python
# src/config/models.py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class RiskRuleConfig(BaseModel):
    enabled: bool
    limit: float
    # ... just enough to pass the test
```

#### Verify Test Passes
```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit/config/test_pydantic_models.py::test_risk_rule_config_valid_data -v
# Should see: PASSED ✓
```

#### Move to Next Failing Test
```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit/config/test_pydantic_models.py::test_risk_rule_config_invalid_limit -v
# Add validation to make this pass
```

#### Refactor While Keeping Tests Green
```python
# After several tests pass, refactor for clarity
# Run full test suite to ensure nothing broke
uv run pytest tests/unit/config/test_pydantic_models.py -v
```

**Repeat** until all tests in that file pass, then move to next file.

---

### Step 4: Respect Clean Architecture Boundaries

**Core Principle**: Configuration is INFRASTRUCTURE (edge), not DOMAIN (core)

**Where Config Lives:**
```
src/
├── config/           # ✅ Infrastructure (you're implementing this)
├── core/             # ❌ NEVER import config directly here
│   ├── risk_engine.py    # Core receives config via dependency injection
│   └── enforcement.py    # Core defines interfaces, not implementations
└── adapters/         # ✅ Adapters can use config to initialize
```

**Dependency Direction:**
```
Core (business logic)
  ↑ depends on
Interfaces (defined in core)
  ↑ implemented by
Config/Adapters (infrastructure)
```

**Example (Right Way):**
```python
# src/core/risk_engine.py (CORE)
class RiskEngine:
    def __init__(self, rules: list[RiskRule]):  # Receives config, doesn't load it
        self.rules = rules

# src/config/config_manager.py (INFRASTRUCTURE)
class ConfigManager:
    def load_risk_rules(self) -> list[RiskRule]:  # Loads and constructs
        config = self._load_toml()
        return [MaxContractsRule(config.max_contracts), ...]

# src/main.py (COMPOSITION ROOT)
config_manager = ConfigManager("config.toml")
rules = config_manager.load_risk_rules()
engine = RiskEngine(rules)  # Dependency injection
```

---

### Step 5: Quality Standards

**Every Module Must Have:**

1. **Module Docstring**
   ```python
   """Configuration management for risk daemon.

   Loads and validates configuration from TOML/YAML files with
   hot-reload support and Pydantic validation.
   """
   ```

2. **Class Docstrings**
   ```python
   class ConfigManager:
       """Manages loading and hot-reloading of risk daemon configuration.

       Supports TOML, YAML, and environment variable overrides.
       Validates configuration using Pydantic models.
       """
   ```

3. **Method Docstrings** (public methods only)
   ```python
   def load(self, path: str) -> Config:
       """Load configuration from file.

       Args:
           path: Path to TOML/YAML config file

       Returns:
           Validated Config object

       Raises:
           ConfigNotFoundError: If file doesn't exist
           ConfigValidationError: If validation fails
       """
   ```

4. **Type Hints** (all functions)
   ```python
   def parse_toml(self, content: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
       ...
   ```

5. **File Size** (<300 LOC per file)
   - If a file grows beyond 300 lines, split it
   - One public class per file maximum

---

### Step 6: Test Incrementally

**Run Tests Frequently:**
```bash
# After implementing each method
uv run pytest tests/unit/config/test_config_manager.py::test_load_toml -v

# After completing a module
uv run pytest tests/unit/config/ -v

# Check coverage
uv run pytest tests/unit/config/ --cov=src/config --cov-report=term-missing

# All tests + coverage
uv run pytest tests/unit/config/ tests/integration/config/ --cov=src/config
```

**Watch Coverage Grow:**
- After models.py: ~30% coverage
- After loaders.py: ~50% coverage
- After config_manager.py: ~70% coverage
- After hot_reload.py: ~85%+ coverage ✓

---

### Step 7: Handle Failing Tests

**If a test fails:**
1. Read the test carefully - what contract is it expecting?
2. Read the architecture doc - what was the design intent?
3. Check your implementation - does it match the contract?
4. Fix the code (not the test!)
5. Re-run the test

**If a test seems wrong** (rare):
- Ask: "Is the test testing the RIGHT behavior per architecture?"
- Check with architecture/16-configuration-implementation.md
- If genuinely wrong, note it for implementation-validator to review
- **DO NOT change test assertions** without user approval

---

### Step 8: Verify Completion

**Before reporting GREEN status:**

```bash
# All tests pass
uv run pytest tests/unit/config/ tests/integration/config/ -v
# Should see: 48/48 PASSED ✓

# Coverage meets target
uv run pytest tests/unit/config/ tests/integration/config/ --cov=src/config --cov-report=term
# Should see: ≥85% coverage ✓

# Linting passes
uv run ruff check src/config/
# Should see: All checks passed! ✓

# Type checking passes
uv run mypy src/config/
# Should see: Success: no issues found ✓
```

## Common Pitfalls (Avoid These!)

### ❌ Don't: Import SDK in Core
```python
# src/core/risk_engine.py
from project_x_py import TradingSuite  # WRONG!
```

### ✅ Do: Use Dependency Injection
```python
# src/core/risk_engine.py
class RiskEngine:
    def __init__(self, broker: BrokerAdapter):  # Interface, not concrete
        self.broker = broker
```

---

### ❌ Don't: Change Test Assertions
```python
# tests/unit/config/test_config_manager.py
assert config.max_contracts == 10  # Test expects 10

# src/config/config_manager.py
return Config(max_contracts=5)  # You return 5, test fails

# WRONG FIX: Change test to expect 5
# RIGHT FIX: Return 10 as the test (and architecture) specifies
```

---

### ❌ Don't: Write Speculative Code
```python
# Don't add features not tested
def load(self):
    config = self._load_toml()
    self._cache_config()  # No test requires caching!
    self._validate_with_schema()  # No test requires this!
    return config
```

### ✅ Do: Write Minimal Code
```python
# Only what tests require
def load(self):
    config = self._load_toml()
    # That's it! Tests don't require more.
    return config
```
