- Hardening checklist → Validate before production
- Penetration tests → Run in Stage 5

**User Documentation → Validation**:
- Installation guide → Verify works on clean system
- Admin guide → Walk through all CLI commands
- Trader guide → User acceptance testing

**Deployment Strategy → Execution**:
- Canary deployment → Use in production rollout

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Risk 1: SDK Data Model Mismatch (HIGH)
**Impact**: Incorrect P&L calculations, wrong enforcement
**Probability**: MEDIUM (audit found 8 mismatches)
**Mitigation**:
1. Implement model transformers (Agent 06)
2. Validate transformations with test account
3. Compare daemon P&L vs broker P&L
4. Add integration test for every mismatch

**Owner**: data-model-reconciler + live-integration-orchestrator

### Risk 2: Performance Degradation (MEDIUM)
**Impact**: Slow event processing, missed enforcement
**Probability**: LOW (benchmarks look good)
**Mitigation**:
1. Establish baselines in Phase 1 (done)
2. Monitor latency in real-time during Phase 2
3. Load test before production
4. Have optimization plan ready

**Owner**: production-health-monitor

### Risk 3: SDK Disconnection Handling (MEDIUM)
**Impact**: Lost events, orphaned positions
**Probability**: MEDIUM (network issues happen)
**Mitigation**:
1. Test reconnection extensively
2. Verify state reconciliation works
3. Chaos test: force disconnects during trading
4. Monitor reconnection success rate

**Owner**: live-integration-orchestrator + end-to-end-validator

### Risk 4: Security Vulnerability (HIGH)
**Impact**: Compromised system, unauthorized access
**Probability**: LOW (audit found issues, but fixable)
**Mitigation**:
1. Fix all HIGH severity vulnerabilities (Stage 4)
2. Run penetration tests (Stage 5)
3. Code review by security expert
4. Continuous vulnerability scanning

**Owner**: infrastructure-designer (implements hardening)

### Risk 5: User Loses Confidence (MEDIUM)
**Impact**: Project abandoned, user won't use it
**Probability**: LOW (vision alignment was 8/10)
**Mitigation**:
1. Keep user informed throughout Phase 2
2. Show test results transparently
3. Let user observe canary deployment
4. Walk through disaster scenarios together

**Owner**: vision-alignment-interviewer (ongoing check-ins)

## Monitoring Strategy

### During Phase 2 Implementation

**What to Monitor**:
- Test pass rate (should stay 100%)
- Coverage (should stay ≥85%)
- Performance metrics (compare to baselines)
- Error rates (should be near zero)
- Memory leaks (continuous profiling)

**Tools**:
- production-health-monitor (real-time)
- Pytest with coverage
- Performance profiler

### After Phase 2 (Production)

**What to Monitor**:
- Event processing latency (<100ms P95)
- Rule evaluation time (<50ms)
- SDK connection uptime (>99%)
- Enforcement accuracy (manual review)
- User satisfaction (check-ins)

**Alerting**:
- Latency >200ms → WARNING
- Error rate >1% → CRITICAL
- Disconnected >5min → CRITICAL
- Memory >700MB → WARNING
