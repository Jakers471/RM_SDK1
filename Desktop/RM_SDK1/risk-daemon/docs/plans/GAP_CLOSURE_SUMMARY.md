### Implementation Roadmap Created

#### ✅ Gap Closure Roadmap
**File**: `docs/plans/gap_closure_roadmap.md`
**Status**: COMPLETE (comprehensive, 600+ lines)
**Contents**:

**Executive Summary**:
- Current state: 72% core logic complete, 0% infrastructure
- Total effort: 15-20 development days (3-4 weeks)
- 5 implementation phases with clear dependencies
- 8 major components (6 P0, 2 P1)

**Dependency Graph**:
```
Phase 1: Configuration (16) [Days 1-4]
Phase 2: Logging (20) + IPC (23) [Days 5-8]
Phase 3: Connection Hardening (21) + State Recovery (22) [Days 9-12]
Phase 4: Service Wrapper (17) + Admin CLI (18) [Days 13-16]
Phase 5: Notifications (19) [Days 17-20]
```

**For Each Component**:
- Architecture document reference
- Estimated effort (days)
- Priority (P0/P1)
- Dependencies
- What it blocks
- Implementation tasks (10-15 per component)
- Success criteria checklist
- TDD workflow handoff specification

**TDD Workflow Integration**:
- Clear agent handoff: gap-closer → rm-test-orchestrator → rm-developer → implementation-validator
- Test coverage targets (>95% unit, >80% integration)
- Handoff message templates for each phase

**Critical Milestones**:
- Milestone 1: Configuration Complete (Day 4)
- Milestone 2: Infrastructure Complete (Day 8)
- Milestone 3: Resilience Complete (Day 12)
- Milestone 4: Admin Interface Complete (Day 16)
- Milestone 5: Production Ready (Day 20)

**Risk Mitigation**:
- 4 identified risks with probability, impact, and mitigation strategies
- SDK integration issues (fix data model mismatches first)
- Windows service complications (use NSSM, not pywin32)
- Hot-reload edge cases (document what requires restart)
- State corruption (atomic writes, backups, validation)

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests (>95% coverage, all mocked)
- Integration tests (>80% coverage, FakeSdk)
- E2E tests (>70% coverage, full workflows)
- Manual testing (service installation, unkillable verification)

**Deployment Checklist**:
- 18 verification items before live trading
- Service installation verified
- Crash recovery tested
- State persistence tested
- Daily reset tested
- All CLIs tested
- Performance targets met (<5% CPU, <500 MB RAM)

**Resource Allocation**:
- Recommended 2-3 developers for parallel work
- Backend (config, IPC, connection)
- Infrastructure (service, logging, notifications)
- Frontend (admin CLI, trader CLI)

**Priority**: CRITICAL (guides all implementation)
**Next Step**: Product Owner review and approval

## Components Requiring Further Architecture Details

The roadmap references 6 additional architecture documents marked as "(to be created)":

### Not Yet Created (Deferred to Next Phase)

**18. Admin CLI Implementation** (`architecture/18-admin-cli-implementation.md`)
- Interactive menu system (rich library)
- Password authentication
- IPC integration
- Command specifications

*Note*: High-level design exists in `06-cli-interfaces.md`. Implementation doc can be created by next architecture agent or rm-test-orchestrator can infer from existing docs.

**19. Notification Providers** (`architecture/19-notification-providers.md`)
- Discord webhook API integration
- Telegram Bot API integration
- Message templates
- Retry logic

*Note*: High-level design exists in `07-notifications-logging.md`. Implementation details straightforward from existing doc.

**20. Logging Framework** (`architecture/20-logging-framework.md`)
- Python logging library setup
- JSON formatter
- Log rotation
- Async writes

*Note*: High-level design exists in `07-notifications-logging.md`. Python logging implementation is standard.

**21. Connection Resilience** (`architecture/21-connection-resilience.md`)
- Exponential backoff
- State reconciliation
- Health monitoring
- Connection state machine

*Note*: Currently connection_manager.py has 0% coverage. This is the MOST CRITICAL missing piece for production.

**22. State Recovery Testing** (`architecture/22-state-recovery-testing.md`)
- Crash recovery test procedures
- State corruption detection
- Verification checklist

*Note*: State management design exists in `04-state-management.md`. This doc focuses on TESTING procedures.

**23. IPC Protocol Specification** (`architecture/23-ipc-protocol-spec.md`)
- JSON-RPC protocol
- HTTP API endpoints
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication

*Note*: Basic IPC concepts in `08-daemon-service.md`. Needs detailed API specification.

---

## Why Some Docs Deferred

**Reason 1: Existing High-Level Docs Sufficient**
- Components 18-20 have comprehensive high-level designs in docs 06-07
- Implementation details are standard patterns (Python logging, rich CLI, webhook APIs)
- rm-test-orchestrator can create test specs from existing docs
- Detailed implementation docs can be created when needed (just-in-time documentation)

**Reason 2: Token Budget Optimization**
- Comprehensive roadmap took priority (600+ lines of critical guidance)
- Two detailed implementation docs (16, 17) provide pattern for others
- Creating 6 more similarly detailed docs would be redundant given existing high-level docs

**Reason 3: TDD Workflow Design**
- Roadmap clearly specifies handoff to rm-test-orchestrator
- Test specifications drive implementation (not architecture docs)
- Architecture docs 16-17 demonstrate required detail level
- Future agents can follow same pattern when creating specs for components 18-23

## Critical Notes for Next Agents

### For rm-test-orchestrator:
- Start with Component 16 (Configuration System)
- Architecture doc is VERY detailed with code examples
- Focus on: validation (JSON schema, Pydantic), atomic writes, hot-reload, cross-references
- Target >95% unit test coverage
- Create integration tests for hot-reload and backup management

### For rm-developer:
- Wait for tests from rm-test-orchestrator (DO NOT start early)
- Follow TDD strictly: Make tests pass one by one (RED → GREEN)
- Use exact libraries specified: pydantic, jsonschema, watchdog, bcrypt
- Implement atomic writes pattern: temp file + os.rename (not direct write)
- Reference architecture doc 16 for implementation patterns

### For implementation-validator:
- Verify >95% unit test coverage
- Verify all integration tests pass
- Run: mypy, ruff check, bandit (security scan)
- Test hot-reload manually (modify config file, verify daemon updates)
- Verify backup created before config modification

### For Product Owner:
- Review roadmap for timeline approval
- Critical path: 13 days minimum (config → logging → IPC → service → CLI)
- Parallel work possible after Phase 1 (can reduce to ~15 days with 3 developers)
- Recommend 4-week timeline with buffer for testing
