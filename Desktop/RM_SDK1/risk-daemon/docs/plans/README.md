# Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed implementation roadmaps and plans for the Risk Manager Daemon project.

## Available Plans

### Gap Closure Roadmap
**File**: `gap_closure_roadmap.md`
**Purpose**: Complete 4-week implementation plan to close all production infrastructure gaps
**Status**: Active roadmap for current development phase
**Covers**: Configuration, Logging, IPC, Service Wrapper, CLIs, Notifications, Connection Hardening, State Recovery

**Key Sections**:
- Current state assessment (72% core logic complete, 0% infrastructure)
- 5-phase implementation plan (15-20 days total)
- Dependency graph and critical path
- TDD workflow integration with agent handoffs
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e)
- Deployment checklist (18 verification items)
- Risk mitigation strategies

**Next Steps**:
1. Product Owner approves roadmap and sets target date
2. rm-test-orchestrator creates test specifications for Phase 1 (Configuration System)
3. rm-developer implements code following TDD workflow
4. implementation-validator verifies completion before moving to Phase 2

## How to Use These Plans

### For Product Owners
- Review roadmap phasing and approve timeline
- Allocate developer resources (1-3 developers recommended)
- Set deployment target date (recommend 4 weeks from roadmap approval)
- Monitor milestone completion

### For Development Agents
- Follow TDD workflow strictly (gap-closer → test-orchestrator → developer → validator)
- Complete components in dependency order (see roadmap Phase structure)
- Achieve coverage targets (>95% unit, >80% integration)
- Hand off to next agent only when all tests pass

### For Manual Testers
- Use deployment checklist in roadmap
- Focus on integration testing between phases
- Verify unkillable behavior, crash recovery, state persistence
- Test with paper trading account before live deployment
