# Risks and Open Questions

## Overview

This document identifies integration risks, unresolved questions, and recommended mitigation strategies for the Risk Manager Daemon integration with project-x-py SDK.

---

## CRITICAL RISKS

### RISK-1: Post-Fill Enforcement Latency

**Severity**: ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**Probability**: CERTAIN (architectural constraint)

**Description**:
Cannot block orders pre-trade. Enforcement happens **after** fill, introducing 120-500ms latency between rule violation and position close.

**Impact**:
- Per-trade loss limits may be exceeded by ~$10-50 during enforcement window
- Combined daily limits accurate (realized + unrealized checked in real-time)

**Mitigation**:
1. âœ… Set per-trade limits conservatively (e.g., $400 limit â†’ close at $350 to account for latency)
2. âœ… Use market orders for instant execution (not limit orders)
3. âœ… Monitor enforcement latency metrics; alert if >500ms

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- 95% of enforcements complete within 500ms
- Max observed enforcement latency <1000ms

**Open Questions**:
- **Q1**: Should we add buffer to per-trade loss limits? (e.g., -$400 limit â†’ enforce at -$350)
  - **Recommendation**: YES. Configure rule threshold = limit - (estimated_latency_loss).

### RISK-2: Race Condition During Account Flatten

**Severity**: ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
**Probability**: LOW (requires precise timing)

**Description**:
When flattening account, new position might open between querying positions and closing them.

**Scenario**:
1. Query positions â†’ [Position A, Position B]
2. Close Position A (OK)
3. **Trader opens Position C** (via web UI)
4. Close Position B (OK)
5. **Position C remains open** (not in original query)

**Impact**:
- Account not fully flattened
- Enforcement action incomplete

**Mitigation**:
1. âœ… After flatten, query positions again
2. âœ… If new positions found â†’ close them (repeat until no positions)
3. âœ… Max 3 iterations to prevent infinite loop
4. âœ… Log all new positions discovered during flatten

**Implementation**:
```python
async def flatten_account_robust(account_id: str, max_iterations: int = 3):
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        positions = await client.search_open_positions(account_id)
        if not positions:
            break  # All closed

        for pos in positions:
            await close_position(pos.contractId)

        if iteration > 0:
            logger.warning(f"Flatten iteration {iteration}: found {len(positions)} new positions")

    # Final check
    final_positions = await client.search_open_positions(account_id)
    if final_positions:
        logger.critical(f"FLATTEN FAILED: {len(final_positions)} positions remain after {max_iterations} iterations")
```

**Open Questions**:
- **Q2**: Should we lock trading during flatten? (prevent new positions)
  - **Answer**: NO - cannot control TopstepX web UI. Log and alert instead.

---

### RISK-3: Missed Events During Disconnect

**Severity**: ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
**Probability**: MEDIUM (network instability)

**Description**:
When WebSocket disconnects, events (fills, position updates) are **not replayed** upon reconnection.

**Impact**:
- Daemon state diverges from broker state
- Rules evaluated on stale data
- False positives (think position closed when it's open) or false negatives (miss violation)

**Mitigation**:
1. âœ… On reconnect â†’ query REST API for positions, orders
2. âœ… Compare with cached state â†’ log discrepancies
3. âœ… Re-evaluate all rules with reconciled state
4. âœ… Alert if significant discrepancies found

**Implementation**: See `Gap 8: State Reconciliation` in [gaps_and_build_plan.md](gaps_and_build_plan.md)

**Open Questions**:
- **Q3**: How to handle positions opened during disconnect?
  - **Answer**: Add to state, re-evaluate rules. If violates rule, close immediately.
- **Q4**: Should we lockout trading after disconnect until state reconciled?
  - **Recommendation**: NO - but flag account as "reconciling" and log all actions during this period.

### RISK-4: Stop Loss Detection Unreliable

**Severity**: ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
**Probability**: MEDIUM (for manually-placed stops)

**Description**:
- SDK Position doesn't include stop loss metadata
- Must query all orders and match by contractId
- Cannot detect manually-placed stops instantly (polling lag)

**Impact**:
- NoStopLossGrace rule may trigger false positives (stop exists but not detected)
- Grace period might close position even if stop attached

**Mitigation**:
1. âœ… Track SDK-placed brackets internally (100% accuracy)
2. âœ… Poll orders every 30 seconds for manually-placed stops
3. âœ… Grace period = 2 minutes (allows time for detection)
4. âœ… Log all detected stops for audit

**Open Questions**:
- **Q5**: Should NoStopLossGrace rule be optional?
  - **Recommendation**: YES - make configurable. Some traders prefer manual stop management.

## MEDIUM RISKS

### RISK-5: Tick Value Hardcoded vs Dynamic

**Severity**: ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
**Probability**: LOW (tick values rarely change)

**Description**:
Tick values (e.g., MNQ = $2/point) are queried from SDK but could change (contract rollover, exchange changes).

**Impact**:
- PnL calculations incorrect if tick value stale
- Rule thresholds based on wrong dollar amounts

**Mitigation**:
1. âœ… Query tick value from SDK (not hardcoded)
2. âœ… Cache per instrument, refresh daily
3. âœ… Log tick value changes for audit

**Open Questions**:
- **Q6**: How often to refresh tick values?
  - **Recommendation**: Daily at 5pm CT (with PnL reset).

---

### RISK-6: Price Cache Stale During Low Volume

**Severity**: ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
**Probability**: LOW (futures are liquid)

**Description**:
If no quotes received for extended period (e.g., after-hours), price cache becomes stale.

**Impact**:
- Unrealized PnL calculations inaccurate
- DailyRealizedLoss rule may not trigger when it should

**Mitigation**:
1. âœ… Timestamp price cache entries
2. âœ… If price >60 seconds old â†’ query REST API for latest price
3. âœ… Log stale price warnings

**Open Questions**:
- **Q7**: Should we disable PnL monitoring during low-volume hours?
  - **Recommendation**: NO - but increase refresh frequency via REST API queries.

---

### RISK-7: Timezone and DST Handling

**Severity**: ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
**Probability**: MEDIUM (twice per year)

**Description**:
5pm CT daily reset must handle Daylight Saving Time transitions correctly.

**Impact**:
- Reset occurs at wrong time (4pm or 6pm) on DST switch days
- Realized PnL not reset properly

**Mitigation**:
1. âœ… Use `pytz` library (handles DST automatically)
2. âœ… Test explicitly for DST transition dates
3. âœ… Log reset time with timezone info

**Testing**:
- March 2nd Sunday (spring forward) â†’ verify reset at 5pm CST â†’ 5pm CDT
- November 1st Sunday (fall back) â†’ verify reset at 5pm CDT â†’ 5pm CST

**Open Questions**:
- **Q8**: Should we use CT (central) or always CST (standard)?
  - **Answer**: CT (America/Chicago) - pytz handles DST automatically.

## LOW RISKS

### RISK-8: Rate Limit Hit During Enforcement

**Severity**: ðŸŸ¢ LOW
**Probability**: LOW (SDK has built-in throttling)

**Description**:
Rapid rule violations â†’ many close orders â†’ hit rate limit (60 req/min).

**Impact**:
- Order placement delayed
- Enforcement latency increased

**Mitigation**:
1. âœ… SDK RateLimiter queues requests automatically
2. âœ… Configure burst_limit=10 for enforcement bursts
3. âœ… Monitor rate limit warnings

**Open Questions**:
- **Q9**: Should we increase rate limit for enforcement actions?
  - **Recommendation**: NO - SDK default (60/min) sufficient for retail trader.

---

### RISK-9: Order Rejection During Enforcement

**Severity**: ðŸŸ¢ LOW
**Probability**: LOW (market orders rarely rejected)

**Description**:
Enforcement close order rejected by broker (insufficient margin, invalid price, etc.).

**Impact**:
- Position remains open despite rule violation
- Critical enforcement failure

**Mitigation**:
1. âœ… Retry close order up to 3 times
2. âœ… If all fail â†’ CRITICAL alert to admin
3. âœ… Log rejection reason for debugging
4. âœ… Fallback: lockout trading for account

**Open Questions**:
- **Q10**: Should we lockout trading after failed enforcement?
  - **Recommendation**: YES - safer to halt trading than allow violations.
