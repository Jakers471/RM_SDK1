# Test Scripts Organization

## MAIN SCRIPT (USE THIS):
- `test` - Master script that does everything

## OPTIONAL/LEGACY (Still work but not needed):
- `run_tests.sh` - Basic test runner (replaced by: ./test)
- `track_coverage.sh` - Coverage tracking (replaced by: ./test)
- `cov` - Coverage report viewer (replaced by: ./test status)
- `view` - HTML opener (replaced by: ./test view)
- `menu.sh` - Interactive menu (replaced by: ./test menu)
- `coverage_report.py` - Python report (replaced by: ./test status)
- `ai_coverage_summary.py` - AI summary (replaced by: ./test ai)

## STILL USEFUL:
- `Makefile` - Standard make commands (alternative to ./test)
- `COMMANDS.md` - Command reference
- `README_TESTING.md` - Quick start guide

The `./test` script combines all functionality into one simple command!
